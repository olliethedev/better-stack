## 👋 Welcome to Better Stack

**@btst - Better Stack** is a composable full-stack plugin system for modern React frameworks.

Instead of building routes, APIs, databases, SSR, and forms from scratch, Better Stack gives you **complete full-stack features as plugins** that work with any modern React framework.

### Key Features

- **🎯 Composable** - Mix and match features like LEGO blocks
- **🔄 Framework Agnostic** - Works with Next.js, React Router, TanStack Router, Remix
- **📦 Full-Stack** - Routes, APIs, database schemas, components, hooks, SSR—everything included
- **🚀 Zero Boilerplate** - Configure and it works

### Available Plugins

**Blog** - Content management, editor, drafts, publishing, SEO, RSS feeds

More plugins coming soon (scheduling, feedback, newsletters, AI assistant, comments). 
Or build your own plugins for any horizontal feature.
